      Masks on and bundled up, The Teacher Fund delivered over $5,000 worth of school supplies to the first cohort of
      six teachers at Borah Elementary in Coeur d'Alene Idaho. These supplies ranged from clip boards to wobble stools
      and everything in between. <br /><br />As we've done now with 2 other schools, Borah has become our third Elementary
      school to support the "new" teachers of that year. Hopefully our budget will allow us to open up the classroom supply
      purchase program to the rest of the school. <br /><br /> For this supply drop, we had
      the help of McKenzie Mattis, one of our high shool senior interns, as well as Christine Woeller. Coincidentally,
      Christine attended this elementary school when she was younger! <br /><br />
      Here are some quotes from the teachers when they learned The Teacher Fund could help them purchase supplies.
      <br /><br />
      "Wow!! I’m in tears over this email! I have spent over a thousand dollars setting up
      and buying supplies for my kindergarten class and now I am being switched to 2nd grade.
      I now have to purchase several new things to teach this grade level. I am so grateful for the help!" - Ms. Osborne
      <br /><br />
      "Bless you. You have no idea how this has blessed us after a very emotional week. I am overcome by your generosity." - Ms Davenport (Principal)

      Prairie View was The Teacher Fund's second elementary school to deliver to
      as we all try to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. Schools are teaching half remote at this point and
      The Teacher Fund is trying to alleviate any pressure we can as teachers do the best they can.
      <br /><br />
      The Prairie View serves about 500 students in North Idaho and we were able to supply three teachers
      with close to $3,000 worth of classroom supplies they've needed. We hope with this infusion of classroom
      supplies the teachers have the best teaching environment possible, especially as we navigate the pandemic.
      <br /><br />

      of Prairie View during the drop off, taken by Christine Woeller.

      The Teacher Fund had the pleasure to help Canfield Middle School in Coeur d'Alene, ID
      with an unconventional yet intriguing request. <br /><br />Usually, The Teacher Fund helps new teachers
      supply their classrooms, so when we were reached out to with a request for petri
      dishes, it was quite the surprise. It turns out that each year, the sixth graders
      at Canfield Middle School perform a sort of science experiment. An experiment where
      each student, or group of students, is given a petri dish. They're then tasked with
      sneezing, coughing, or rubbing some gross material into the petri dish and following
      the progress of bacterial development within the petri dish. As you can imagine,
      this is an AWESOME experiment full of surprise and wonder at the demons our bodies
      are strong enough to fight off. <br /><br />With Covid-19, this experiment became even more
      topical, and budget constraints even tighter. The experiment was at risk of being
      cancelled due to a lack of funds when Mrs. Robitaille reached out to us for help.
      We gladly supported the experiment and purchased 400 petri dishes, as well as
      supporting supplies for the experiment. Below you can see pictures of the drop-off,
      where our two interns from Coeur d'Alene high school helped out. McKenzie Mattis
      and Kate Nicklay are both seniors at CHS and volunteered to help us run the
      Teacher Fund. We couldn't be doing as much as we are without their help.
      In the pictures you'll also see Christine Woeller and Joel Wasserman, cofounders of The
      Teacher Fund. <br /><br />We didn't hang around long enough to see what fungi would be
      overcome those petri dishes in a few short weeks...

      Covid-19 derailed our Spring delivery for Ponderosa Elementary, but we know it derailed much more
      than that for teachers in School District 271.
      This was the first semester of remote learning for Ponderosa Elementary, and we can't imagine
      the hardship.<br /><br /> Ponderosa was our first school to deliver supplies to
      in the fall of 2019, so they hold a special place in hearts. Last fall, we only
      had the budget to support 3 teachers at Ponderosa. This Spring,
      after a surge in donations, we finally
      had the budget to open up our supply purchase program to any teacher at the school,
      letting them purchase any classroom supplies they hadn't yet been able to due
      to financial constraints. <br /><br />
      See the pictures of this dropoff below, this was the first time we could fill
      THREE cars with classroom supplies! You'll see Cami Williams, Deon Watson, Joel Wasserman,
      Alan Wasserman, and Ms. Powers, a teacher at Ponderosa!

      Our first supply drop! The culmination of months of effort to start The Teacher Fund is here!
      We worked with three teachers for this drop to help them supply their classrooms. Ms. Powers,
      Ms. Olp, and Ms. Young received school supplies with this drop. Class was in session while
      we were dropping off the supplies and at one point in the band room, a student said "They're angels!".
      It caused us all to pause. <br /><br />
      94% of teachers spend out of pocket to supply their classrooms. More often than not, that means classrooms
      are inadequately supplied... The kid's eyes lit up when they saw supplies being brought into their classrooms
      box after box. All made possible due to our donors, so THANK YOU. <br /><br />
      Deon Watson, Christine Woeller and Joel Wasserman helped with this supply drop.
