        Over the past year The Teacher Fund has focused on fulfilling our ever growing public school
        teacher connections wishlists, resulting in over $4,000 donated to supply 1st and second year public
        school teachers with the supplies they've deemed would make the learning environment better.<br /><br />
        If you know a public school teacher in need, send them our way!

        The Teacher Fund returns to Seattle after our 2022 fundraiser (led and organized by Michael Baldovino) to replace all
        remaining chalk boards in Broadview Thompson K-8 classrooms with whiteboards,
        purchasing over $14,000 worth of whiteboards as well as the labor to install them.
        This is crucial for both teacher health (dust from chalkboards) as well as speed and flexibility
        in teaching!<br /><br />
        Broadview Thompson remains under The Teacher Fund umbrella, meaning each semester The Teacher Fund will reach out
        and help any new teachers joining Broadview Thompson outfit their classroom.

      The Teacher Fund took to Seattle the spring of 2022 to help outfit any teacher who needed classroom supplies
      at Broadview Thompson K-8, purchasing over $15,000 worth of classroom supplies. From books to soap to fidget
      spinners, the teachers were overwhelmed with appreciation for their complete overhaul.
      "I am in shock you were able to order it all. It will be Christmas in March!".
      "I often receive requests for tools like pencil grips or sensory accommodations
      like fidget tools and wiggle cushions and haven't always had the resources available
      to help. With everything you sent (pictured below - and I think there is more to come
      still! THANK YOU!!!), so many more Broadview-Thomson students will be better equipped
      for success at school. I really, really appreciate it!"
        <br /><br />
      Broadview Thompson is now under The Teacher Fund umbrella, meaning each semester The Teacher Fund will reach out
      and help any new teachers joining Broadview Thompson outfit their classroom.
        <br /><br />For this supply drop, we delivered direct to the teachers, check out some pictures below!

      In our largest haul yet, The Teacher Fund opened up support to every teacher at Borah Elementary
      and delivered over $10,000 worth of school supplies. This meant every teacher, no matter how long they've been
      teaching, was able to purchase school supplies they thought their classroom needed. We do not advise or hold
      back teachers on what they choose to purchase, it is solely up to them to decide what they think would make
      for the best learning environment in their classrooms.
        <br /><br />
      At this point Borah Elementary is now under
      the Teacher Fund Umbrella, meaning any new teacher Borah hires will be able to purchase school supplies
      through The Teacher Fund, at no cost to them. We hope this support will help Borah recruit
      and retain teachers, in a time when Idaho public school funding is taking a hard hit.<br /><br /> We
      hope over the course of the next year to bring more elementary schools under our Umbrella so no teacher
      has to pay out of pocket to supply their new classroom.
        <br /><br />For this supply drop, we had
      Deon Watson, Christine Woeller and Joel Wasserman helping deliver.

      Masks on and bundled up, The Teacher Fund delivered over $5,000 worth of school supplies to the first cohort of
      six teachers at Borah Elementary in Coeur d'Alene Idaho. These supplies ranged from clip boards to wobble stools
      and everything in between. <br /><br />As we've done now with 2 other schools, Borah has become our third Elementary
      school to support the "new" teachers of that year. Hopefully our budget will allow us to open up the classroom supply
      purchase program to the rest of the school. <br /><br /> For this supply drop, we had
      the help of McKenzie Mattis, one of our high shool senior interns, as well as Christine Woeller. Coincidentally,
      Christine attended this elementary school when she was younger! <br /><br />
      Here are some quotes from the teachers when they learned The Teacher Fund could help them purchase supplies.
        <br /><br />
      "Wow!! Iâ€™m in tears over this email! I have spent over a thousand dollars setting up
      and buying supplies for my kindergarten class and now I am being switched to 2nd grade.
      I now have to purchase several new things to teach this grade level. I am so grateful for the help!" - Ms. Osborne
        <br /><br />
      "Bless you. You have no idea how this has blessed us after a very emotional week. I am overcome by your generosity." - Ms Davenport (Principal)

      Prairie View was The Teacher Fund's second elementary school to deliver to
      as we all try to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. Schools are teaching half remote at this point and
      The Teacher Fund is trying to alleviate any pressure we can as teachers do the best they can.
        <br /><br />
      The Prairie View serves about 500 students in North Idaho and we were able to supply three teachers
      with close to $3,000 worth of classroom supplies they've needed. We hope with this infusion of classroom
      supplies the teachers have the best teaching environment possible, especially as we navigate the pandemic.
        <br /><br />

      of Prairie View during the drop off, taken by Christine Woeller.

      The Teacher Fund had the pleasure to help Canfield Middle School in Coeur d'Alene, ID
      with an unconventional yet intriguing request. <br /><br />Usually, The Teacher Fund helps new teachers
      supply their classrooms, so when we were reached out to with a request for petri
      dishes, it was quite the surprise. It turns out that each year, the sixth graders
      at Canfield Middle School perform a sort of science experiment. An experiment where
      each student, or group of students, is given a petri dish. They're then tasked with
      sneezing, coughing, or rubbing some gross material into the petri dish and following
      the progress of bacterial development within the petri dish. As you can imagine,
      this is an AWESOME experiment full of surprise and wonder at the demons our bodies
      are strong enough to fight off. <br /><br />With Covid-19, this experiment became even more
      topical, and budget constraints even tighter. The experiment was at risk of being
      cancelled due to a lack of funds when Mrs. Robitaille reached out to us for help.
      We gladly supported the experiment and purchased 400 petri dishes, as well as
      supporting supplies for the experiment. Below you can see pictures of the drop-off,
      where our two interns from Coeur d'Alene high school helped out. McKenzie Mattis
      and Kate Nicklay are both seniors at CHS and volunteered to help us run the
      Teacher Fund. We couldn't be doing as much as we are without their help.
      In the pictures you'll also see Christine Woeller and Joel Wasserman, cofounders of The
      Teacher Fund. <br /><br />We didn't hang around long enough to see what fungi would be
      overcome those petri dishes in a few short weeks...

      Covid-19 derailed our Spring delivery for Ponderosa Elementary, but we know it derailed much more
      than that for teachers in School District 271.
      This was the first semester of remote learning for Ponderosa Elementary, and we can't imagine
      the hardship.<br /><br /> Ponderosa was our first school to deliver supplies to
      in the fall of 2019, so they hold a special place in hearts. Last fall, we only
      had the budget to support 3 teachers at Ponderosa. This Spring,
      after a surge in donations, we finally
      had the budget to open up our supply purchase program to any teacher at the school,
      letting them purchase any classroom supplies they hadn't yet been able to due
      to financial constraints. <br /><br />
      See the pictures of this dropoff below, this was the first time we could fill
      THREE cars with classroom supplies! You'll see Cami Williams, Deon Watson, Joel Wasserman,
      Alan Wasserman, and Ms. Powers, a teacher at Ponderosa!

      Our first supply drop! The culmination of months of effort to start The Teacher Fund is here!
      We worked with three teachers for this drop to help them supply their classrooms. Ms. Powers,
      Ms. Olp, and Ms. Young received school supplies with this drop. Class was in session while
      we were dropping off the supplies and at one point in the band room, a student said "They're angels!".
      It caused us all to pause. <br /><br />
      94% of teachers spend out of pocket to supply their classrooms. More often than not, that means classrooms
      are inadequately supplied... The kid's eyes lit up when they saw supplies being brought into their classrooms
      box after box. All made possible due to our donors, so THANK YOU. <br /><br />
      Deon Watson, Christine Woeller and Joel Wasserman helped with this supply drop.
